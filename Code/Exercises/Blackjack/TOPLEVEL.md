# Problem decomposition.

The problem is first decomposed to a top level solution and then further refined to provide lower levels until we arrive at an algorithm we can convert to code.

## Top level decomposition

This is the high level decomposition of the overall problem and the initial sub problems.

I think there are 4 basic things we need to do. Deal the cards, player plays, dealer plays, work out who is the winner. The main actions can be defined as functions. The top level decomposition then is as follows. 

> Play a game of blackjack against the computer
>> Define a deal
>> Define how to identify a winner
>> Define the actions for the players hand
>> Defince the actions for the dealters hand

There will be other steps to look at which will form the main loop of the program.
