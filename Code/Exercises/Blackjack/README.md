## Activity Overview

Blackjack is a card game also known as Pontoon. The aim of the game is to score 21 against the dealer. The aim of this activity is to create an initial decomposition of the requirements set out below, refine those requirements into an algorithm and to then convert the algorithm to working code.

## Basic rules of the game.

The game uses a standard deck of cards comprising 4 suits of 13 cards.
The cards are each given a calue as follows  
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.
- Picture cards are always worth 10 points
